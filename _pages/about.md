<div align="justify">Javier Heras-Domingo received his BSc in Chemistry (Mention in Materials Science), MSc and PhD from the [Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467950436.html) (UAB). His PhD degree, supervised by Prof. Mariona Sodupe and Prof. Xavier Solans-Monfort, consisted in a comparison between Ruthenium oxide surfaces and nanoparticles in terms of their catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. During this period, he also has collaborated with Prof. Christophe Coperet at the ETH institute (Switzerland), in a project related to a supported Iridium single-site catalyst (SAC) on ITO.

After obtaining his PhD (International Mention) in Theoretical Chemistry in January 2020, he has currently joining [Prof. Zachary Ulissi's](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/) research group at the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in Pittsburgh (USA) to work on Machine Learning and Highthroughput technics in catalysis.</div>
