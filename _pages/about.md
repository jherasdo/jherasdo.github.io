Originally from Barcelona, I studied chemistry (Mention in Materials Science) at the [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html) before doing my Ph.D. thesis in the [Computational BioNanoCat](https://compbionanocat.wordpress.com/) laboratory supervised by Prof. Mariona Sodupe and Prof. Xavier Solans-Monfort. My Ph.D. thesis consisted in a comparison between Ruthenium oxide surfaces and nanoparticles in terms of their catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). During this period, I collaborated with Prof. Christophe Coperet at the ETH Zurich (Switzerland), in a project related to a supported Iridium single-site catalyst (SAC) on ITO, in fulfillment of the Ph.D. international mention.

In February 2020, I joined [Prof. Zachary Ulissi's](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/) research group at the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) in Pittsburgh (USA) to work on multi-metallic oxides discovery for clean energy production based on Machine Learning and autonomous workflow engineering, in collaboration with [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/) team at Meta AI and Prof. Ted Sargent's research group at the University of Toronto.

In January 2023, I joined Prof. Núria López's research group at the [Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ)](https://www.iciq.org/).
