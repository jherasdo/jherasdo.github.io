I am a chemist from Barcelona with a strong interest in materials science, catalysis, and artificial intelligence (AI). My work lies at the intersection of computational chemistry and machine learning, with a growing focus on the Digital Chemistry field, using data-driven and automated approaches to accelerate chemical discovery.

I earned my degree in chemistry with a specialization in Materials Science from the [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html), and later completed my Ph.D. in the [Computational BioNanoCat](https://compbionanocat.wordpress.com/) research group under the supervision of Prof. Mariona Sodupe and Prof. Xavier Solans-Monfort. My doctoral research focused on comparing the catalytic performance of Ruthenium Oxide (RuO2) surfaces and nanoparticles for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

As part of my Ph.D., I conducted a research staty at ETH-Zurich in collaboration with Prof. Christophe Copéret, where I investigated supported iridium single-atom catalysts (SACs) on indium tin oxide (ITO). This collaboration contributed to the international mention of my Ph.D.

In 2020, I joined [Prof. Zachary Ulissi's](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/) group at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) as a postdoctoral researcher. There, I focused on the discovery of multi-metallic oxide catalysts for clean energy technologies, combining high-throughput computations, machine learning models, and autonomous workflows. This work was carried out in collaboration with the [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/) team at Meta AI and Prof. Edward Sargent's group at the University of Toronto.

From January 2023 to mid-2025, I have been a postdoctoral researacher in the group of Prof. Núria López's at the [Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia (ICIQ)](https://www.iciq.org/), where I focused on developing AI-powered approaches for catalysis. As of mid-2025, I have begun a new position as Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the [University of Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/en/), where I continue to pursue research at the intersection of chemistry, data science, and automation, while also contributing to academic teaching and mentoring.
